			Description
		</p>
		<p class="lt">			 
			A fun form of verbal battle, wherein you compete as to who can speak the most in a
			creative way (without getting your mic seized).<br><br>
			1 FIRST ROUND<br>
			• The contestants will be divided into several groups.<br>
			• Each group will be given a random topic by the moderators upon which any person among
			the team can start with the discussion.<br>
			• Each group member can speak for a maximum of 1 minute. The moderator shall give a
			warning after 50 secs, followed by the final warning at the end of 60 secs.<br>
			• Anyone from the group can interject the speaker on grounds of 3 types of abnormalities,
			that are- Repetition, Stutter, and Deviation.<br>
			• The interjector has to carry on the discussion from the point where he/she interjected the
			speaker and complete their "JAM".<br>
			• After a speaker rests his/her voice after 60 secs, any group member can start another "JAM"
			until all of them have spoken.<br>
			• Marks shall be awarded on the basis of fluency, confidence, type of content, creativity and
			the impact on the audience.<br>
			• Additional marks will be given for the amount of time you speak and the number of
			interjections you make.<br><br>
			2 SECOND ROUND<br>
			• This round is a simple one. It will be a rapid-fire round in which the contestants will have to
			answer the questions asked by the moderator. The one who’ll answer the maximum number
			of questions in 1 minute will be crowned as Undisputed Champion of JAM - Just A Minute.<br>
			• But since every movie has a climax in it, there is one in this round too. The questions that
			will be asked by the moderator, the participants must answer them in an irrelevant way,
			failing to do so will lead to no further questions.<br><br>
			• For Example:<br>
			Moderator: What is your name?<br>
			You: I like Your shoes.  <br><br>
			3 JUDGING CRITERIA<br>
			All the participants will be judged on the basis of the following factors: Creativity, Content, Fluency,
			Confidence, Impact on the audience.<br>
			In the first round, Judges will play their role by giving you marks on the following points:<br>
			• Repetition: if the speaker repeats any of his/her points in the span of 60 minutes.<br>
			• Stutter: If the speaker stutters or finds it difficult to speak about the topic in the span of 60
			secs.<br>

			• Deviation: If the speaker deviates from the given topic or speaks about something non-
			relevant.<br>

			In Round 2 will be, you’ll be judged on the basis of the following:<br>
			• The maximum number of questions answered by one team/individual.<br>
			• How irrelevant and amusing their answer is!<br><br>
			4 PRIZE<br>
			With hard work comes always some fruitful results. Every person participating in this event is
			working hard as Rocky Balboa. As we know what it takes to speak in front of a crowd, that’s why we
			have decided to keep the prizes worth 9K.<br>
			5 PARTICIPATION FEE<br>
			The participation fee would be Rs. 150/-<br>
			6 ADDITIONAL BENEFITS<br>
			Free participant in the flagship events of Media Cell, Duologue where strangers start a conversation
			while being blindfolded.<br>
			The one participating in all four events, The Scribbled Stories Workshop, Photography Workshop by
			Haramkhor, JAM, Duologue, the total registration fees for them will be 400.
