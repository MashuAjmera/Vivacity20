			Description
		</p>
		<p class="lt">			 
			When people don’t express themselves, they die one piece at a time. And what’s a better way
			to express than to Roar, Roar so high that the world is forced to sit and take notice!
			Nukkad Natak serves as an excellent platform to express one’s views and is the most energetic
			event at VIVACITY. This year, the rules for the competition are as follows:<br><br>
			JUDGING CRITERIA:<br>
			1. Loudness: Voice and impact on the audience.<br>
			2. Constraint: Uniqueness, innovation and improvisation in terms of executing the
			transformation.<br>
			3. Time Limit: Exceeding the time limit will result in the deduction of marks.<br>
			4. Team: Music and narration, coordination, relevance to the theme and overall performance.<br>
			5. Use of props.<br>
			6. Crowd Interaction: Participation with crowd in the play.<br><br>
			RULES:<br>
			1. Prior online registration is required.<br>
			2. It is a team event. Team size limit to 22 members, including performers, musicians,
			drummers etc.<br>
			3. Each member of the team is required to carry their ID cards.<br>
			4. Theme selection is open. All the teams can have a theme of their own choice.<br>
			5. Each team will be allotted 30 minutes for their performances (including stage setup).
			Points will be deducted for exceeding the time limit.<br>
			6. Props should be arranged by the teams on their own. Use of fire or any hazardous material is strictly prohibited.<br>
			7. Vulgarity of any kind would lead to disqualification of team from the event. Hence if the team
			feels that any kind of act, expression or dialogue design can be deemed as vulgar, it is
			strongly advised to consult the organizers than performing it directly on stage.<br>
			8. Use of electronic musical instruments is not allowed.<br>
			9. The organizers take the liberty to check on any sort of misconduct during the stay of the
			teams and would take necessary actions whenever required. Please maintain the integrity of
			the competition.<br>
			10. The decision of the judges and the organizing committee will be final and binding.
